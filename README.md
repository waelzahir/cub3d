# Cub3d

Welcome to the `Cub3d` project! This is a 3D game created using the C programming language and the Raycasting rendering technique, inspired by Lodev's Raycasting Tutorial. In this project, you will be able to move through a maze and collect items while trying to find the exit.

## Getting Started

To get started with the `Cub3d` project, you will need to have a few things installed on your computer:

- GCC compiler
- Make build automation tool
- Minilibx graphics library
- Git version control system

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/paji/cub3d.git`
2. `cd` into the repository: `cd cub3d`
3. Build the project: `make`
4. Run the game: `./cub3D maps/map.cub` or `Make B`

## Gameplay

The objective of the game is to find the exit of the maze while collecting as many items as possible. Use the arrow keys to move around and the `ESC` key to quit the game.
